# AI-Driven Chatbot for Enhanced Restaurant Ordering

An AI-powered, AWS-driven chatbot designed to transform the restaurant ordering process by offering customers a personalized, seamless experience. This system integrates conversational AI, voice interactions, image recognition, and multichannel communication to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Overview
In todayâ€™s restaurant industry, traditional ordering methods struggle to meet customer demands for speed, convenience, and personalization. Our solution addresses this gap using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AI technologies, providing a flexible, scalable platform that automates order-taking, offers recommendations, and engages customers through multiple channels.



## Key Features
- **Conversational AI**: Amazon Lex enables natural, intuitive conversations with customers for easy order placement and support.
- **Voice Responses**: Amazon Polly provides text-to-speech responses, creating a more engaging, accessible experience.
- **Image-Based Ordering**: Amazon Rekognition analyzes images for menu item suggestions, enhancing the customer experience.
- **Multichannel Support**: Integration with WhatsApp (via Twilio) allows customers to order from their preferred messaging platform.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Amazon SNS sends updates to keep customers informed about their orders.
- **Scalable, Serverless Backend**: AWS Lambda and Amazon EC2 offer flexibility to handle high demand with minimal latency.

## System Architecture
The system uses a modular, serverless architecture with these core AWS services:
- **Amazon Lex**: Processes natural language for AI-driven chat interactions.
- **AWS Lambda**: Manages backend operations, handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Amazon Polly**: Converts text responses to speech.
- **Amazon Rekognition**: Recognizes items in uploaded images, assisting with menu suggestions.
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends real-time order status notifications.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors system performance and reliability.
